GRAPa Project
* GRAPA Project * is made up of a series of individual works
interrelated survey, registration and promotion of Heritage
Acoustic from different regions of our country.

- * Acoustic surveys in 3D audio *

- * Musical records and / or heritage rituals in Virtual Reality *

- * Promotion of musical creation for site-specific works *

- * Audiovisual series of micro documentaries collecting the work done *

Sounds in space
The musical creation and execution for the West is governed by parameters
established in which both performers and listeners maintain
static and preset locations, such as a theater,
where the public has its place in the seats, while the artists
they remain on the front stage.

In order to understand the musical and ritual practices that
they are foreign to these modes, it is necessary to experience them in the way
in which they recreate that, in the vast majority of cases, they propose
immersive listening experiences, in which, by its very practice, the
space plays a fundamental role expanding sound perception beyond
of visual limits.

In the search to offer the viewer a more experiential experience
acoustically and visually complete, is that we use specific technology to
record these musics and rituals.

The immersive recording in audio and video allows to spread these practices
much closer to an * emic * description, framed in its
place of origin and enriching the understanding of the worldview that
communities express in their cultural practices.

# EN ###################################
Acoustic heritage
We refer to the Acoustic Heritage as those places that due to their
morphological and environmental characteristics involve the listening experience
as an inseparable part of the environment.

These acoustic aspects vary over time as a consequence
of the use, the environmental transformations and the degradation of its
materials.

For this reason we see it necessary to portray these spaces through studies
acoustic and morphological to preserve their characteristics.

We record these sound features by performing acoustic measurements
specific using Impulse Responses with Ambisonics microphones and
directional sources.

Acoustic Surveys
A series of surveys were carried out in each space
topographic and acoustic in order to date, as faithfully as possible
particularities in each formation and the positions of each issuer and
receiver.

Due to the topographic characteristics of these spaces (great
irregularity of its walls and floor with differences in level) is
It is necessary to make diamond grids at a fixed height that allows
relieve the different positions of the source and receiver with a
clear reference, covering four extreme points of the enclosure,
using as a stakeout tool a topographic level.

Documentary Audiovisual Record
We made an audiovisual documentary series in which the
fieldwork experience (acoustic studies and records
musicals).

This series shows how, the exploration of each space (study
morphological and loudness in each case), is exposed and
enhanced by experiencing it through the sound produced by
instruments and voices typical of each musical practice in dialogue with the
landscape.

Musical Practices in Virtual Reality
To record the music of different spaces, we use
filming technologies and specific sound recording.

Immersive audio and video recording allows you to broadcast the chord
to its practice and framed in its place of origin. From mechanisms
Playback for Virtual Reality, the viewer has a
more complete experiential experience by being able to locate at points where
that artistic expression becomes more relevant, such is the case, for
example of a round of couplets you register from the very center of the
round.

In the Province of Salta (Argentina), the renowned couplet ** [Mariana
Carrizo] (http://www.marianacarrizo.com.ar/)** finds a deep
relationship between box singing and these valleys, in whose landscapes
learned to sing in childhood. His participation in the GRAPa Project was
indispensable for the recognition and learning of the Song of
Copla in relation to the landscape.

# EN ###################################
The Places and Music
The spaces where to make these records, beyond having them
taken into account for its acoustic characteristics and the soundscape that
they comprise them (in most cases unique), they are determined
for several factors:

- * Significant use that it has and had for society *

- * Tourist and cultural attraction *

- * Accessibility *
      
From an exhaustive investigation, it was decided to explore seven
spaces, grouped into three regions of the Argentine Republic, relating
each region with the song, music and cultural expressions that the
integrate:

- * Northwest Region *

- * Cuyo Region | Patagonian *

- * Northeast Region *

# EN ###################################
Northwest Region
Characteristic region for Valleys and Quebradas adjoining the
Andes mountain range, has Protected Areas that were part of the
ancient Inca trail in Argentina. Three will be studied in this region
spaces: * "The Amphitheater" * in the Quebrada de las Conchas (Salta), * Parks
Provincials of Ischigualasto and Talampaya * (San Juan) and * "La Quebrada de
Humahuaca ”* in La Puna (Jujuy).

* The song of the Copla * is one of the identity expressions of the
region, practiced by different communities since times
ancestral and orally transmitted.

Its form of execution is closely linked to the natural environment, which is why
We consider that it is a clear exponent of the Acoustic Heritage and
Sonorous. As a cultural practice, it is ritualized in rounds
improvised where the boxes and voices alternate continuously.

# EN ###################################

Less than 40 kilometers from the city of Cafayate on the route
Nacional Nº68, a few meters from the Río de las Conchas, is * El
Amphitheater*.

It is a semi-closed rock formation so
pseudo-ogival sculpted by erosion. Its particular shape and
material of its walls make it have an acoustic quality
exceptional, recognized in the region and which has started, for
example, to the cycle of the "Concert in the Mountain",
annually in this space since 1991.

Cuyo Region | Patagonian
Arid and steppe regions, both Cuyo and Patagonia, are

Two significant cave formations studied in each region:
* Cavern of the Witches * in the Department of Malargüe
(Mendoza) and * Cueva de las Manos * in the Cañadón del Río
Paintings (Santa Cruz).
          
These regions were inhabited by the Huarpe and Mapuche communities,
who manifested a variety of recreational songs and music and
tied to their beliefs. Shamanic singing predominates in both cases
and the drum as an identity element. Similarly, the tribes
pre-tehuelches (Aoni-Kenk) much more related to the Cañadón del Río
Paintings, in addition to singing, have a group of instruments such as the
koolo, the Rambo and percussion instruments such as the Aple, El Chelper and the rattle.

It is a closed cave formation, located 8 km north of
R.N. No. 40, near the town of Bardas Blancas in
the Rio Grande Valley, south of the province of Mendoza, in the
Malargüe department.

Our studio is focused on the largest and most accessible room,
recognized for its acoustic characteristics and the pace of
pre-existing communities called * Room of the Virgin *.

Its closed access, approximately 15 meters long, gives
a room 35 meters deep and 20 meters wide
approximately with an irregular height that reaches 10
meters at some points.

# EN ###################################
Northeast Region
From this region it is proposed to study two known National Parks
as: * El Impenetrable * (Chaco) and * Iguazú * (Misiones), both are characterized
for its fauna and flora, where hundreds of species can be found today
considered in danger of extinction. In this way, its Protected Areas enjoy
a unique soundscape in Argentina.

Culturally, these spaces were inhabited by communities between
those that stand out the Guaycurúes, known as Qom. Your practices
musicals are expressed in coexistence with the soundscape that gives
origin. They stand out for collective songs and soloists accompanied by
instruments like * n’viqué * (a kind of single-string violin)
and percussive instruments such as carob pods, hooves, maracas
and pumpkin rattles like * cartexetẽ *.

About G.R.A.Pa Project
** G.R.A.Pa. Project ** was formed in 2017 based on cooperation
between the National University of Quilmes (UNQ) and the Catholic University
de Salta (UCaSal) in order to carry out a survey of the
acoustic of the Natural Amphitheater of the Quebrada de las Conchas. In 2018
We expand the objectives of the project by relating it to the singing of the
Copla from the sound environment typical of its origins. We count,
Since then, with the participation of the couple from Salta, Mariana
Carrizo, artist committed to the fight for preservation and
revaluation of this ancestral song.

From there, we started a research and production project of
immersive content, in which the relationship between native music
and its natural acoustic environments are clearly expressed. Our
purpose is to document the Acoustic Heritage, which we understand covers
both the music itself and the acoustic and sound environment in which
is created.
